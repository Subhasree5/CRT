A left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements 1  unit to the left. The elements that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d, rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result.
Example
d=2
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
After 2 rotations,arr'=[3,4,5,1,2] .

Function Description

Complete the rotateLeft  function with the following parameters:

int d: the amount to rotate by
int arr[n]: the array to rotate
Returns
int[n]: the rotated array
: the rotated array
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers that denote n, the number of integers, and d, the number of left rotations to perform.
The second line contains n space-separated integers that describe .import java.io.*;


Constraints
1<=n<=10^5
1<=d<=n
1<=a[i]<=10^6
Sample Input

STDIN      Function
-----      --------
5 4         n = 5 d = 4
1 2 3 4 5  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
Explanation

To perform d=4  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

[1,2,3,4,5]->[2,3,4,5,1]->[3,4,5,1,2]->[4,5,1,2,3]->[5,1,2,3,4]
